2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
I have been very lucky to work most recently in places that are quite accepting of people and ideas, and encourage talking to your team in and out of work.<br>
However that doesn't mean there are not some toxic things happening in the workplace it can be a lot of have and have nots, and quite a bit of gatekeeping on knowledge<br>
there can be quite a bit of unspoken expectations that come up. Although yes it can be great to read the minds of your co-workers and can help to de-escalate things pretty<br>
quickly it can also be the reverse, you can really know the best/worst way to truly annoy someone. 
My current second job, if i said what it was you would probably think that each night was like a wrestling match, and although the amount of fights that have happened is<br>
pretty minimal it still happens. However in all of this turmoil, there are someo of us who have been at it for a very long time, who have slowly shifted our bits of the service<br>
industry to be more inclusive, and to change the mindset of if one section is making money there is no reason we need to be upset about that or have FOMO we could all be making<br
money, or maybe tomorrow it will be our section that makes money. So we have really shifted it to be a place you can feel safe, you can bring all your problems with you inside<br>
because someone will check up on you and make sure you have what you need be it professionally or personally. We do really incourage bringing up any issues you may have with<br>
another server and talking it out, at least doing your best to try and listen and take feedback and have a chance to respond. 

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
I really think communication is key, you cannot be afraid to speak your mind and to tell someone you think they are absolutely correct and you were 100 percent wrong.
Being able to have interactions and relationships with your team outside of work is so important, one should never under estimate a groupchat with a healthy<br>
amount of memes
